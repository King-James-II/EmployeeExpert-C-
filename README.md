## Employee Management System

This C++ program demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, input validation, and control flow. It provides functionalities for managing employees, including viewing profiles, searching, adding, editing, and deleting.

## Key Concepts
- **OOP:** Utilizes classes and inheritance for representing different employee types and behaviors.
- **Polymorphism:** Overrides functions like `viewProfile()` and `showMenu()` for specialized behavior.
- **Input Validation:** Validates user ID and password inputs to ensure data integrity.
- **Control Flow:** Uses loops and conditional statements to handle user interactions and program flow.
- **Modularization:** Organizes functionality into functions and classes for reusability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used
- **C++:** Primary language for implementation.
- **Standard Library:** Utilizes standard library headers for input/output, string manipulation, and character classification.

## Usage
1. **Compile and Run:** Compile the program and execute the compiled executable.
2. **Login:** Enter user ID and password to access the system.
3. **Main Menu:** Navigate through options to manage employees.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source code.
